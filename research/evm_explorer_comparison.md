# A Comprehensive Analysis of Etherscan and Blockscout: Pros, Cons, and Alternatives

## Introduction

As a developer building an OP-Stack-based rollup, one of the critical decisions you'll need to make is selecting a suitable blockchain explorer. Blockchain explorers are like a pair of binoculars - providing transparency and insights into what is happening on the chain. They function as block explorer search engines to offer users an interface that provides them with detailed information on transactions, addresses, contracts and network statistics. The blockchain explorer can be used to verify the status of transactions, look at all things within each block and gets a better understanding of how the chain works.

Their vital function - at least where decentralization and transparency are concerned - is to ensure that blockchain technology works in a decentralized way. They enable you to monitor and audit blockchain activities in a real-time manner which is critical for developers, investors, researchers or everyday users. Developers mainly utilize blockchain explorer for debugging smart contract and verifying proper implementation.

When it comes to exploring the Ethereum blockchain and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), two explorers stand out: Etherscan and Blockscout. Started back in 2015, Etherscan.co has been the best go-to for investigating anything and everything on Ethereum blockchain with its rich data set, intuitive UI & features. Meanwhile, Blockscout is an open-source multi-chain solution with flexible and allows for customization for developers.

This article aims to compare Etherscan and Blockscout, two popular tools for exploring the Ethereum blockchain and its related networks. We'll dive deep into what these platforms can do, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.  Finally, we will also give a brief overview of some alternative explorers to ensure you get an idea of all the great tools out there for exploring blockchains.
